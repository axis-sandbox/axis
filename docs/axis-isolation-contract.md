# AXIS Isolation Contract

## Status And Scope

This is the shared AXIS isolation contract. It defines the policy semantics
that every backend adapter must preserve, whether the backend is AXIS-native,
MXC-backed, process-based, container-based, or VM-based.

Platform-specific documents and backend plans may describe how an operating
system or runtime enforces this contract. They must not redefine the contract
itself. If a backend cannot enforce a required behavior exactly enough for the
selected mode, AXIS must reject the policy before user code starts.

## Contract Model

AXIS policy is the source of truth. Backend adapters translate policy only
after validation and capability planning prove that the selected backend can
deliver the requested behavior.

Every policy/backend pair must produce one of these outcomes:

| Outcome | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `Exact` | The backend plus any AXIS-owned layers enforce the requested policy. |
| `ExactWithHostDependency` | The policy is enforceable only when a declared host dependency is present. Missing dependencies fail before spawn. |
| `WeakerOnly` | The backend provides a weaker behavior that is not equivalent to the requested policy and must be selected explicitly. |
| `Unsupported` | The policy/backend pair cannot satisfy the contract and must be rejected before spawn. |

Backends may also mark a policy surface as AXIS-owned when the backend starts
the workload but AXIS remains responsible for enforcement. Examples include the
strict network proxy, supported local credential injection, inference routing,
audit aggregation, and some lifecycle cleanup.

## Shared Invariants

These invariants apply to all platforms and backend families:

- Unsupported policy combinations fail before user code starts.
- Missing host dependencies fail before user code starts unless the selected
  policy explicitly allows the weaker or absent behavior.
- A backend setup failure must not fall back to unsandboxed host execution.
- A weaker backend behavior must never be reported as exact enforcement.
- Backend probes must not mutate host policy, install local artifacts, change
  OS features, or rely on previous developer-machine setup.
- Runtime errors must preserve the original failure while still attempting
  complete cleanup.
- Sandbox-visible configuration, argv, environment, files, inherited file
  descriptors, logs, and audit records must not contain raw provider secrets.
- Security decisions that require binary identity, sandbox identity, or route
  identity fail closed when that identity is unavailable or ambiguous.

## Filesystem Semantics

AXIS filesystem policy defines what the sandboxed workload may read or write.

Required behavior:

- Read-only paths may be read but not modified by the sandbox.
- Read-write paths may be read and modified by the sandbox.
- Denied paths must be inaccessible or masked so the sandbox cannot inspect
  their contents, metadata, or symlink targets beyond what the platform
  unavoidably exposes.
- Denied paths take precedence over read-only and read-write grants.
- Workspace and temporary directories must be scoped to the sandbox or policy
  and must not widen access to the caller's home directory.
- Symlink, hardlink, path traversal, and canonicalization behavior must not
  allow a granted path to escape into a denied path.

If a backend cannot represent a deny rule exactly, AXIS must either add an
AXIS-owned layer that masks the path exactly, select another backend, or reject
the policy. A backend that merely ignores deny rules is `Unsupported` for that
policy.

## Network Semantics

AXIS network policy has distinct modes. They are not interchangeable.

### Allow Mode

`network.mode: allow` permits host networking for the workload. Endpoint allow
or deny policy is not enforced in this mode unless another explicit AXIS-owned
network enforcement layer is selected. A policy that combines allow mode with
endpoint restrictions must be rejected unless such a layer is present and
planned as `Exact`.

### Block Mode

`network.mode: block` denies outbound IP networking from the workload. It must
not inject proxy environment variables or leave a documented direct-egress path
open. If a backend can only partially block networking, that backend is
`Unsupported` for block mode unless the policy explicitly selects a weaker
behavior.

### Strict Proxy Mode

`network.mode: proxy` means strict AXIS proxy isolation:

- direct outbound network access is denied;
- the sandbox can reach only the AXIS proxy or router endpoint needed for the
  policy;
- endpoint policy is evaluated by AXIS outside the sandbox;
- supported local provider credentials are injected only at the host-side policy boundary;
- direct bypass attempts are denied and auditable where the platform can
  provide evidence;
- binary-restricted endpoint policy requires reliable connect-time attribution
  or another equally strong identity mechanism.

If binary attribution, sandbox identity, or proxy reachability cannot be proven,
strict proxy mode is `Unsupported` for that backend and host state.

### Cooperative Proxy Mode

Cooperative proxying is not strict proxy isolation. A backend that only sets
`HTTP_PROXY`, `HTTPS_PROXY`, or related environment variables while sharing host
networking provides a weaker behavior because clients can ignore those
variables or open raw sockets directly.

Cooperative proxying may be exposed only as an explicitly weaker mode with a
`WeakerOnly` outcome. It must not silently satisfy `network.mode: proxy`.

## Process And Identity Semantics

AXIS process policy covers the command, arguments, working directory,
environment, user identity, process tree, terminal mode, timeout, and exit
status.

Required behavior:

- The executed command, argv, cwd, and environment must match the planned
  sandbox launch.
- Environment filtering must remove inherited provider secrets and inherited
  proxy credentials unless AXIS intentionally adds sanitized values.
- `run_as_user` must not run as root and must fail if the requested identity
  cannot be prepared safely.
- Process-tree limits, process groups, sessions, and job handles must not allow
  child processes to escape timeout or destroy behavior.
- PTY support must be planned explicitly. A backend without PTY support is
  `Unsupported` for policies that require it.
- Exit status, stdout, stderr, and timeout status must report the sandboxed
  workload, not an unrelated wrapper failure unless wrapper setup failed before
  spawn.

## Credential Semantics

Raw credentials are host-side policy material. The sandbox may receive
placeholders, dummy values required by client libraries, or AXIS-generated
proxy settings, but not raw provider keys.

Required behavior:

- Raw provider credentials must not appear in sandbox environment variables,
  MXC JSON, backend config files, argv, logs, audit records, or sandbox-visible
  files.
- Provider credentials are resolved and injected only by AXIS-owned host-side
  proxy or router code for supported policy-allowed requests.
- Host-boundary injection is currently limited to explicit local `http://`
  routes. Remote plaintext and HTTPS credential routes are unsupported and
  fail before launch.
- Missing required credentials fail closed for the route that needs them.
- Unsupported credential placeholders fail closed.
- Error messages must name the missing or unsupported credential reference
  without printing the credential value.

## Inference Semantics

Inference policy describes how sandboxed workloads reach local or external
model providers.

Required behavior:

- `inference.local` remains the explicit managed local inference endpoint.
- External provider hosts are governed by ordinary network and provider policy;
  they must not be implicitly rewritten into local inference routes.
- Local inference routing, provider failover, streaming, model discovery,
  embeddings, and chat or responses APIs must preserve sandbox identity and
  route policy.
- If TLS interception, local CA trust, streaming, or protocol inspection is
  required for a route and the backend cannot support it, the route is
  `Unsupported` unless an AXIS-owned layer supplies exact behavior.
- HIP Remote and GPU-related inference support must keep hardware access
  outside the sandbox unless the selected policy explicitly allows otherwise.

## Resource Semantics

Resource policy includes process count, memory, CPU, timeout, and backend
native limits.

Required behavior:

- Requested limits must be enforced by the backend or an AXIS-owned layer.
- A missing resource primitive is `Unsupported` unless the policy explicitly
  allows a documented weaker fallback.
- CPU limits must not degrade into no CPU enforcement.
- Process-count fallbacks that depend on user identity must require an identity
  that cannot affect unrelated host processes.
- Cleanup must remove resource groups, job handles, cgroups, temporary state,
  and backend lifecycle objects after normal exit, timeout, failed spawn, and
  partial setup failure.

## Lifecycle And Cleanup Semantics

AXIS lifecycle policy covers create, start, exec, destroy, timeout, daemon
shutdown, and repeated cleanup.

Required behavior:

- User code starts only after all required isolation layers are planned and
  applied.
- Partial setup failure must clean all state created before the failure.
- Destroy must be idempotent.
- Timeout must stop the full sandbox workload and any backend-owned child
  processes, containers, or VM sessions.
- Cleanup failures must be reported without hiding the original sandbox
  failure.
- Stateful backends must make persisted state explicit in policy or launch
  options. Hidden state reuse is not allowed.

## Audit And Evidence Semantics

Audit records are part of the security contract because they explain policy
decisions and denied behavior.

Required behavior:

- Denials must identify the policy surface, backend, sandbox identity, and
  reason without exposing raw secrets.
- Missing optional evidence may be reported as a skip only for tests or
  diagnostics. Runtime policy enforcement must still fail closed when evidence
  is required.
- Direct network bypass attempts in strict proxy mode must be denied. They
  should be auditable where the platform provides reliable evidence.
- Backend capability probes, dependency skips, and unsupported combinations
  must produce actionable messages.

## Platform Appendices And Backend Maps

Platform appendices and backend capability maps must use this contract
vocabulary. They should describe:

- which policy surfaces are `Exact`, `ExactWithHostDependency`, `WeakerOnly`,
  or `Unsupported`;
- which host dependencies or OS features are required;
- which enforcement layers are backend-owned and which are AXIS-owned;
- which tests prove the behavior;
- which behavior is intentionally unavailable.

Appendices may mention platform primitives such as Landlock, seccomp,
Seatbelt, AppContainer, Job Object, LXC, Bubblewrap, WHP, KVM, or Hyper-V.
Shared AXIS code and public policy semantics should not depend on those
primitive names.
